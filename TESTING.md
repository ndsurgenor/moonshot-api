## Manual Testing

The following sections list a number of manual tests undertaken to ensure the site operates according to details listed under [Scope](README.md#scope) and [Structure](README.md#structure) in the README file. Specific dev goals/user stories can viewed (where appropriate) by hovering over the numbers listed under 'Ref(s)' in the tables below; clicking these links will open the relevant section in the README file.

### Navigation

These tests ensure that a user can successfully navigate the site using the provided navbar links, text links, images, and username tags. Many areas of the site require a username and password for full access; as such, the  username _testname_ and password _test#123_ have specifically been created for testing purposes; specifics around this access are tested below under [Authentication](#authentication). Note that the tests below require 'signed out' status unless otherwise specified.

### Responsiveness

These tests check that the site responds correctly at various sizes of screen, resizing, hiding, and reformatting elements where necessary. Many areas of the site require a username and password for full access; as such, the  username _testname_ and password _test#123_ have specifically been created for testing purposes; specifics around this access are tested below under [Authentication](#authentication). Note that the tests below require 'signed out' status unless otherwise specified.

### Get, Post, Put & Delete (CRUD) Functionality

These tests determine if a user is able to successfully - or otherwise - create (post), view (get), update (put) and/or delete photos, stars, comments, or gear/account info through the front-end capabilities of the site. In all test cases, **one must first sign in** to the site before completing any of the other steps listed (the username _testname_ and password _test#123_ have specifically been registered for this purpose), while the descriptor 'valid details' indicates that the following is expected:

- Required fields (*) are not left blank
- Invalid values/formats have not been added to a field

<!-- ## Automated Testing

A number of automated tests have been written to provide additional validation alongside those manual tests which check for a user's ability to view the booking section, depending on whether or not they are authenticated, as well as attempts to update/delete bookings which do not belong to a user.

All of these tests are found within the [tests.py](booking_sys/tests.py) file in the repository.

![Automated](static/images/testing/testing-automated.png) -->

## Validator Testing

### W3C
HTML copied from the page source of the deployed frontened has been passed through [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and shows 8 info comments regarding trailing slahes but no errors.

All CSS files have been passed through Jigsaw, the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and have also been found to be without any errors

<!-- ### PEP8
All Python files in the booking_sys and eaststreet apps, as well env.py and manage.py, have been passed through the [Code Institute PEP8 Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). The only warnings given were for the settings.py file which contains a small number of long lines (i.e. greater than 80 characters) under AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS; as this is code implemented by Django itself at setup, these lines will be left unchanged.  -->

### Quick Lint JS
JSX code and JavaScript files have been checked throughout this workspace with [Quick Lint JS](https://quick-lint-js.com/) and no issues have been found.

## Accessibility & Performance

[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) was used to used to produce reports on performance and accessibility for both desktop and mobile versions of the site; results are provided in the table. In all cases the SEO score was 100 which was achieved after adding meta 'keyword' and 'description' tags to the index.html head section.

| | |**Desktop**| | |**Mobile**| |
:-----|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
**Page**|**Performance**|**Accessibility**|**Best Practices**|**Performance**|**Accessibility**|**Best Practices**
**Home (signed-out)**|56|85|95|43|86|95
**Sign Up**|99|93|95|90|93|95
**Sign In**|99|94|95|91|94|95
**Home (signed-in)**|25|85|95|49|91|91
**Upload**|96|82|95|76|81|91
**Photo Detail**|59|88|95|48|94|95
**Profile**|82|83|95|67|89|95
**Gear**|97|93|95|91|100|95
**Account**|96|91|95|91|100|95
**_Averages_**|**_79_**|**_88_**|**_95_**|**_71_**|**_92_**|**_94_**

The performance on both desktop and mobile produced the lowest scores as longer loading times come from images loading on to the screen. In future development it would be advisable to look at quicker ways of retreiving image data in order to improve these scores.
